## Use with VieweD

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/sruon/XiPackets-definitions/releases) and decompress the content of the `viewed` folder into your `VieweD` installation in the `data\ffxi` folder.

## Use with Lua

```lua
local c2s = require('c2s.lua')
```

## Notes
- Certain structures may have been slightly modified when compared to the `XiPackets` project, to ease the parsing.
- Packets with no names in the `XiPackets` project have been given relatively meaningful name.
